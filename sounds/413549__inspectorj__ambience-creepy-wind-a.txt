Please comment on where you intend to use the sound, and feel free to post a link to the work where you used it if you want (I enjoy watching/listening to anything you create!)

You don't have to worry about crediting this sound if you are using it for non-commercial projects unless you want to (e.g. educational or non-profit activities), but if you use the sound for a commercial project you must credit the sound. If you would prefer to not have to give attribution for commercial projects, then take a look at the attribution-free license.

An example of how you might credit is by putting this in the description/credits:
